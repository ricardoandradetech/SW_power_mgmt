A DIY Approach to Remote Power Management for Legacy but Reliable L2/L3 Switches

This project is all about taking well-known, off-the-shelf technology and putting it to work in a practical, no-nonsense way. The goal? To remotely power on and off a Cisco Catalyst switch (or really any other vendor) without having to physically unplug anything. The setup uses an ESP32 microcontroller paired with a 5V relay to control the power, while an old ISP modem adds Wi-Fi connectivity, and a Fortigate VPN makes it all securely accessible from anywhere.

Let’s be honest—this isn’t a groundbreaking invention. Relays have been used to control power for ages, and pairing one with an ESP32 for remote control is a classic DIY move in the IoT world. What makes this project stand out isn’t some revolutionary new technology—it’s the way everything has been pieced together to solve a specific problem.

At its heart, the project is about smart integration and customization, not reinventing the wheel. It’s proof that sometimes, the best solutions aren’t flashy—they’re just practical, effective, and tailored to the task at hand. It’s a clever way to make life easier, and while it might not be a game-changer, it’s a solid example of creative problem-solving in action.
